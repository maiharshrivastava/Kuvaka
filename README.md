# Chat Application

This is sole project done by me(Nakshatra Trivedi)!

This repository contains a **real-time chat application** built using **Node.js**, **Socket.IO**, and **ReactJS**. It is organized into two main directories:

- **client/**: The ReactJS-based frontend.
- **server/**: The Node.js backend with Socket.IO for real-time communication.

## Features

- Join chat rooms and communicate in real-time with a unique `chatID`.
- View a list of active users in the room.
- Message synchronization across all connected clients.
- Group chat functionality using `chatID`.

## Run this App Locally

To run the chat application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nakshatrrra/kuvaka-assignment

2. **Backend:**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm i
   npm run dev

1. **Frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm i
   npm start



## What I could have added more:

1. Mongodb integration to store chats in chat/message schema.
2. Allow user login before starting chat to create secure environment.
3. Used JWT for secure API.
4. Use .env for secret keys and all currently now added as there is only port right now.


P.s. :- I've already used chat functionality in my last internship at Storytent.
